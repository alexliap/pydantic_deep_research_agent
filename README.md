# Open Deep Research

Deep research feature is one of the core tools in today's chatbot applications. This is a simple, configurable, fully open source deep research agent that works across many model providers, and search tools. This implementation is using Pydantic AI and is inspired by the [langchain-ai/open_deep_research](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research) repository.
